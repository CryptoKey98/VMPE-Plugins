### Notes
* **Note on muting/unmuting players:** Player name is not case-sensitive. If you are muting/unmuting an online player, you may only need to enter several beginning characters of the player's name instead of the full name (like "Leo" instead of "Leo3418").
* **Note on using commands beginning with `/realmute`:** You can use alias `/rmt` for faster operations. For instance, you can use `/rmt status` instead of `/realmute status`.
* **Description of fake message notification:** Muted players will see a fake chat message in their client when they send one, so they will think that their message is successfully sent. The message is still invisible to other players.
* **Note on adding keywords:** You can add an exclamation mark before the word if you want to match the whole word only. For example, if you add `!bo`, `boy` will not be blocked, but `bo y` will be blocked.
